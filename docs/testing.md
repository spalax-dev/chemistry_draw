# Testing Policy

> How to write tests that actually catch bugs.
> A test's value = its ability to **fail when the code is wrong**.

---

## 0. Delivery order: docs → test → implement → review

Every change follows this order; a test is never written before the docs that
define the contract, and implementation never starts before a failing test
exists.

1. **Docs** — real work, not an afterthought: update `README.md`,
   `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/conventions.md`, `docs/verification.md` or
   `docs/CHECKPOINTS.md` as the change requires, and describe the expected
   behaviour and how it will be verified.
2. **Test** — add the failing test and confirm RED (section 2).
3. **Implement** — write the minimal code to make it pass, confirm GREEN, then
   refactor.
4. **Review** — the reviewer checks the docs, the RED→GREEN evidence, the phase
   order and the harness (`docs/verification.md`).

Enforcement:

- Every task in `activities.json` declares `phase`:
  `docs | test | implement | review`.
- `scripts/lib/activity-policy.mjs` validates the phase order
  (non-decreasing) and the agent mapping. `node scripts/harness.mjs` runs it
  and `scripts/lib/activity-policy.test.mjs` before allowing work to proceed.
- **Docs-only exception**: an activity with `type: "docs"` runs `docs` →
  `review` and must not contain `test` or `implement` tasks.

The reviewer rejects work with no docs task, no failing test before the
implementation, or phases out of order.

---

## 1. Core principle: the mutation mindset

Before writing a test, ask: _"If this function were broken — deleted, returned
the wrong value, or crashed on input X — would this test fail?"_

If the test would still pass, it has no value. Rewrite it or delete it.

---

## 2. Test-first (Red-Green-Refactor)

Backend behaviour is written **test-first**, after the docs task. The test is
the contract; the code is what makes it pass.

1. **Write the test** in `src-tauri/sidecar/src/tests/` — it must fail on the
   current code (or fail to compile because the symbol does not exist yet).
2. **Run it → confirm RED**
   `cargo test -p indigo-server <name>`.
3. **Implement** the minimal code to make it pass.
4. **Run → confirm GREEN**.
5. **Refactor** (tests stay green).

Enforcement:

- A task may be `in_progress` or `done` only when every earlier task in the
  activity is `done` (docs → test → implement → review).
- The reviewer asks: _"would this test have failed before the implementation?"_
  If not, the test was not written first (or is too weak) — reject.

---

## 3. Structure

- **AAA**: Arrange (build the request/state) → Act (call once) → Assert (verify
  the observable outcome).
- **One scenario per test.**
- **Naming**: `test_<unit>_<behavior>_<condition>` — the name states the
  contract (e.g. `corrupted_molfile_returns_400`).

---

## 4. Sidecar test patterns

Tests live in `src-tauri/sidecar/src/tests/`, one module per domain, registered
in `tests/mod.rs`.

```rust
use crate::tests::*;
use axum::http::StatusCode;

#[tokio::test]
async fn health_reports_status_and_port() {
    let app = test_app();
    let (status, body) = fetch_get(&app, "/v2/health").await;

    assert_eq!(status, StatusCode::OK);
    assert_eq!(body["status"], "ok");
    assert_eq!(body["port"], 9321);
}
```

Rules:

- Use `test_app()` (full router) for endpoint tests; no sockets, no ports.
- Assert both the **status code** and the meaningful body fields.
- Include the negative path: malformed JSON (422/400), invalid molecule (400),
  unknown route (404).
- No real network. Native Indigo is linked, so chemistry tests are real — that
  is the point.
- Absence is tested cross-platform in `tests/imago_absent.rs`: `/v2/info` and
  `/v2/health` expose no `imago_versions` / `imago_worker`, and `/v2/imago/*`
  returns 404. The same module runs on Linux and Windows CI, so no
  `#[cfg(windows)]` variant is needed.
- The packaging contract tests (`scripts/lib/*.test.mjs`) assert `externalBin`
  never lists `imago-worker`, and that `scripts/check-native-libs.sh` fails on a
  directory holding `libimago*`/`*opencv*` files (case-insensitively, including
  broken symlinks) and passes silently on a clean one. They also cover the
  `--allowlist <source-dir>` mode: a bundled file absent from the builder image
  fails with "not provided by the builder image", while a missing target
  directory only warns on stderr.
- Never test private state (`obj.field`); test behaviour.

---

## 5. Frontend

There is no JS test runner configured yet. Frontend correctness is currently
verified by `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm build`, and the manual checklist in
`docs/verification.md`.

If you add a test runner (Vitest is the natural fit), document it here and add
it to the harness before writing tests that depend on it.

---

## 6. Assertion quality

### Strong assertions

- Deterministic results → assert the **exact** value/structure.
- Endpoints → status **and** body.
- Errors → assert the message contains the actionable cause.
- Files/render output → assert the format and non-empty payload, not just "no
  crash".

### Forbidden anti-patterns

| Pattern                                       | Why it is weak                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `assert!(true)` / no assertion                | Verifies nothing                    |
| Asserting only "did not crash"                | Says nothing about the outcome      |
| `assert!(result.is_ok())` alone               | Ignores the value under test        |
| Asserting `is_some()`/`is_not_none()` alone   | Almost always true                  |
| Reading private state                         | Tests implementation, not behaviour |
| Tests that depend on order or wall-clock time | Flaky by construction               |
